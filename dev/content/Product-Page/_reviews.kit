            <h4>Amazing Toaster</h4>
            <p>This really is an amazing toaster - as anyone can imagine with SMEG products, it’s all very pricey and there are definitely ones cheaper that work just as well. However, if you have the extra money this is definitely a nice thing to have. Its sleek, works great, and has a cool design.</p>

            <h4>Best Toaster Ever</h4>
            <p>Bought this almost a year ago, and waited to see how I’d like it long term. It’s beautiful, functional and toasts beautiful without burning.</p>

            <h4>Broken after less than a year</h4>
            <p>Disappointed this is being advertised as a best seller, my toaster’s lever broke within a year of purchase.</p>

            <h4>Pretty and functional</h4>
            <p>I have used this toaster almost everyday for a week. Although the color on the website looked slightly different than it does in-person.</p>
